# aciee-hackathon-2023

**About:** <br />
Hi! This is the winning stash from ACIEE Hackathon that took place in november 2023 and where we got the third prize!

**The Context:** Practice has shown that the events generating emergency situations cannot always be avoided, but they can be managed, their effects being reduced through a systematic process that involves the establishment of measures and actions designed to contribute to reducing the risk associated with these phenomena.
In recent years, driving a vehicle has become an important part of our daily lives, especially in busy urban areas. Can technology help reduce unsafe factors on public roads?

Therefore, we crafted a program that uses face reading to detect drowsiness and alert the user of the imminent danger he's in. We were given a Raspberry Pi 4 along with a PiCamera to make our project on!

**Made with Python.** <br />

**Libraries Used:**
- OpenCV
- dlib
- SciPy
- Tkinter
- Pillow
